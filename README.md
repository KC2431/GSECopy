This repository contains the code for the paper "Group-wise Sparse and Explainable Adversarial Attacks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17434).

## Setup
To run this code:
- Download the NIPS2017 data set (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nips-2017-defense-against-adversarial-attack/data) and extract it to Saves/Data/NIPS2017/.
- Install https://github.com/akamaster/pytorch_resnet_cifar10.
- Add the images you want to use for figures 1, 2, and 3 to Saves/Data/images/, and update the lists 'imgfiles', 'imglabels', and 'imgtargets' in main.py accordingly.
